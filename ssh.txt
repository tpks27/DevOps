SSH
Secure Shell
- Protocol to communicate with the other computers
- All the traffic is encrypted
SSH is the client
SSHD (Open SSH Daemon) must be installed to use SSH

ssh {user}@{host}
User represents the account that you want to access
The host is the computer that you want to access. It can be an IP address or a domain name;
IP e.g., 123.234.45.56
Domain name: www.tpk.com


Setting Password Authentication for the AWS ec2 instance:

Open the sshd_config file:
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config and change the line containing PasswordAuthentication no to PasswordAuthentication yes

Save the file and restart the sshd service using the following command:
sudo service sshd restart

Now you can log in using the password instead of the .pem file.

Login into the server using the key which is generated on the local machine:

1.	Generating the key in the local machine:

ssh-keygen

keys are generated in the .ssh directory.
For example:
.ssh ls
id_rsa      id_rsa.pub  known_hosts

2.	Adding the key to the server

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh username@IP_address/domain_name "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys”
 or 
ssh-copy-id username@IP_address/domain_name

and next type the Server’s password to copy the key generated in the local machine
  
now login into the server directly - ssh username@IP_address/domain_name

Secure copying of files:

Let us consider 2 servers, Server1 and Server2 and a Local Machine

1.	Copying a file from Server1 to Server2 (Push Operation)
Login into the server1 machine  scp SourcePathofFile(Server1) Destination(username@IPaddress/Domain_name:DestinationPath)

For example: 
scp /home/ec2-user/test.txt ec2-user@ec1-2-345-000-99.xxxxxxxxxxxxx.com:/home/ec2-user/

Password: (of the destination Server)

scp /home/ec2-user/test.txt ec2-user@Public_IP:/home/ec2-user/

Password:

scp /home/ec2-user/test.txt ec2-user@Private_IP:/home/ec2-user/

Password:

Since both the servers belong to the same network, we can copy the files using the private IP also which is commonly used among organizations.

2.	Pulling a file from Server1 to Server2

Login into the server2  scp source-user@IP/DomainName:filePath DestinationPath

Password: (of Source Server {here Server1})

Example: scp ec2-user@IP_address:/home/ec2-user/test.txt /home/ec2-user/


3.	Copying file from Local Machine to the server 
Consider transferring from Local machine to Server1
scp /zzz/yyy/xxx/test.txtuser@PublicIP_address/DomainName:Destination_path
Example: scp /zzz/yyy/xxx/test.txt ec2-user@1.234.124.11:/home/ec2-user/
