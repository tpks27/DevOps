GITHUB
To connect the GitHub, 

It should have the public key of your computer
Create the SSH key pair
ssh -keygen
To keep the ssh-keygen simple, do not enter any key name or passphrase.
- /Users/user_name/.ssh/
Name of the file - id_rsa.pub
Adding SSH key to your GitHub account 
GitHub Account -> Settings
Settings -> SSH and GPG keys 
click on New SSH Key. Assign some meaningful name to your key
cat id_rsa.pub
Copy the content of the key
Paste the key inside your GitHub account
Now you can clone your GitHub repo and it will not complain about git@github.com permission denied (publickey). fatal could not read from remote repository

Benefits of this approach
1.	You do not need to supply you GitHub Username and password
2.	More secured


Drawback
The process of generating SSH keys is little troublesome.
If you switch your laptop/desktop then you need re-generate the SSH keys again and perform the same steps onto your new laptop/desktop
This is one more approach in which you do not need to worry about SSH key generation.
You need following -
1.	GitHub repo URL with HTTPS
2.	Your GitHub Username
3.	Your GitHub Password
